    A PYGAME WITH PYTHON.
  </h5>
  <p class="t-oblique">Category: "Game Development."</p>
  <p>
    This is a game development project comprising of a 2-D game built using 
    Pygame, a Python module. The game was created and designed using Python's 
    native class objects, and by consistently splitting code into manageable
    potions for further development. Writing this game offered me an 
    opportunity to enhance my game development and problem-solving skills.
    I had to grapple with the many challenges I faced, climb over huddles to
    create a working, playable game. I have titled this game as <i>'Game 
    Character'</i>; a particular game object (the player) combats enemy
    ships moving in a systematic manner up, down, and across the screen. 
    The game features escalating levels, a scoring system, an updated high 
    score and limited player-lives. I enhanced it by introducing sound and 
    music effects using Pygame Mixer module.

    I have included a snapshot of my program and a short video file below 
    to demonstrate my work. The complete code for this game can
    be accessed in my GitHub repository to which I am <a href="https://github.com/frankTheCodeBoy/PYGAME_GAME_DEVELOPMENT">
    linking here.</a>

    Point of note: the video embedded is slightly shaky due to the fact
    that I was recording the screen interface with one hand while 
    simultaneously accessing the program and playing the game with my other 
    hand. You could however play the clip in full-screen mode or download
    it for improved clarity.
