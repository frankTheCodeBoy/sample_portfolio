    VISUALISING GLOBAL DATASETS.</h5>
  <p>
    This section depicts striking visualisations of recent global earthquakes
    in the scale of 1.0 and above, generated using Plotly. The methodology 
    used involved analysing geo-json earthquake data using Python's objects
    and modules.<br>
    Plotly's Graph Object enabled useful access to Scattergeo and Layout 
    which were used to generate the world map. The relevant data to be
    plotted was obtained by extracting relevant features from json data,
    and appending them into Python-lists. The output is as shown below.

  <p>
    Hovering the cursor over the colored dots on the map, allows a label to
    pop-up highlighting relevant information in a useful way. 
    The size of the dots correspond to the earthquake magnitude in 
    that location.<br>
    The color-scale used here, <i>Viridus</i>, was deliberately chosen in
    order to highlight the map in a theme suited to earthquakes.
