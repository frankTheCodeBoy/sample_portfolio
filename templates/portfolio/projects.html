      <h5 class="mark-one"> 1).<span 
        class="new-standtxt">REAL-TIME API DATA VISUALISATION.</span></h5>
      <p>
          The concept of working efficiently with the API of a particular
          technology is what this project demonstrates. This includes the 
          following steps:- accessing the API and making an API call via 
          Python's request object, verifying and translating the data returned,
          and using Python's Plotly module to analyse and create a visualisation
          of this data.
          <br>
          The result is a neat graph with active links showing real-time data 
          at that moment. Below is one such graph which shows real-time data in 
          the form of "top news headlines in the USA". Each time the code is
          run, the graph updates to showthe most current news articles.
          I was able to accomplish this by working with the <i>NEWS API</i> and 
          by using a unique API-key. Below is the resulting visualisation.
          My code can quickly be accessed in my 
          <a href="https://github.com/frankTheCodeBoy/REALTIME_API_DATA_AND_EARTHQUAKES_VISUALISATION">GitHub repository.
          </a><br>
          There is a similar visualisation to this one, drawn alongside. It was
          generated using data from <i>HACKER NEWS API</i>. At any instance of 
          running code, it will show the most commented topics in Hacker News 
          at that moment. For both these visualisations, the links on the 
          graphs once clicked, will navigate to the actual article.

        A PYGAME WITH PYTHON.
      </span></h5>
      <p>
        This is a game development project comprising of a 2-D game built using 
        Pygame, a Python module. The game was created and designed using Python's 
        native class objects, and by consistently splitting code into manageable
        potions for further development. Writing this game offered me an 
        opportunity to enhance my game development and problem-solving skills.
        I had to grapple with the many challenges I faced, climb over huddles to
        create a working, playable game. I have titled this game as <i>'Game 
        Character'</i>; a particular game object (the player) combats enemy
        ships moving in a systematic manner up, down, and across the screen. 
        The game features escalating levels, a scoring system, an updated high 
        score and limited player-lives. I enhanced it by introducing sound and 
        music effects using Pygame Mixer module.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have included a snapshot of my program and a short video file below 
        to demonstrate my work. The complete code for this game can
        be accessed in my GitHub repository to which I am <a

        Point of note: the video embedded is slightly shaky due to the fact
        that I was recording the screen interface with one hand while 
        simultaneously accessing the program and playing the game with my other 
        hand. You could however play the clip in full-screen mode or download
        it for improved clarity.

        THE LEARNING-LOG PROJECT.</span></h5>
      <p>This project is again a live web application built with Python and Django 
      framework. The application serves as an online journal for daily activity
      entry. Users register and create accounts to actively use it. The application 
      features topics; public and private topics, and entries which are added to
      topics created. Users track their activities and learning progress by 
      logging new topics and updating it with new ideas which appear in form
      of entries unique to owners.<br>
      Prior to deployment, necessary tests were conducted and git-tracking  was 
      enabled consistently. Code was finally configured for production after the 
      necessary migrations were conducted locally and on the server. This application 
      which is named <i>'Learning Log'</i>, is currently active and can be directly
      accessed through this<a href="https://favourite-activity.herokuapp.com">

        Point of note: depending on your network strength or location, the link
        to the web application may take roughly 5 - 7 seconds to load up at first.
        At the least, give it this minimum time limit.

        VISUALISING GLOBAL DATASETS.</span></h5>
      <p>
        This section depicts striking visualisations of recent global earthquakes
        in the scale of 1.0 and above, generated using Plotly. The methodology 
        used involved analysing geo-json earthquake data using Python's objects
        and modules.<br>
        Plotly's Graph Object enabled useful access to Scattergeo and Layout 
        which were used to generate the world map. The relevant data to be
        plotted was obtained by extracting relevant features from json data,
        and appending them into Python-lists. The output is as shown below.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hovering the cursor over the colored dots on the map, allows a label to
        pop-up highlighting relevant information in a useful way. 
        The size of the dots correspond to the earthquake magnitude in 
        that location.<br>
        The color-scale used here, <i>Viridus</i>, was deliberately chosen in
        order to highlight the map in a theme suited to earthquakes.

        AN ANDROID APPLICATION.</span>
      </h5>
      <p>
        Programming languages have their own uniqueness in terms of practical
        adaptability towards completing and executing task of varying nature.
        Java programming language is usually a convinient choice for creating 
        android applications. As such, I have developed a simple but
        fully-functional 'Number Guessing Game' as an android application
        written in Java.<br>
        The application translates user-input and gives feedback, stores 
        user-settings, preferences, and tracks user-scores. With the collective 
        technologies of Eclipse and Android Studio, I cross-tested it across 
        multiple-device simulations and also deployed it in my own android device.
        The <i>apk</i> for this application is accessible from this <a 
        href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IszaHUnW4vRde1y75JrKYfKwQ1DJFXk9/view?usp=sharing">link.</a>

      <p>
        A worthy social-site usually realies heavily on an appealing interface,
        and responsive behaviour for optimum user-experience. This section 
        introduces one such site which implements collective languages:- HTML, 
        CSS, PHP, JavaScript with JQuery, MySQL, and AJAX, to achieve an optimum 
        user-experience coupled with dynamic behaviour.<br>
        This networking website implements the following features :- User 
        accounts, Profile updates with Photo-upload, Friendships and Followings, 
        Public postings and Private messaging between members. Additionally, 
        Sign-up and Log-in functionalities are enabled.<br>

        MACHINE LEARNING DATA ANALYTICS.
      </span></h5>
      <p>
        Creating machine algorithms and models that work well, usually involves 
        combining the processess of data visualisation and data analysis. 
        In this section, Python library and modules were used to mould machine 
        models from validated and tested algorithms. Here I have included 
        illustrations of some models that were trained and tested on various 
        datasets involving both Supervised and Unsupervised learning problems.
        <br>
        The first illustration shown below applies simple linear regression 
        toward solving a supervised problem. The dataset was a CSV format data
        containing varying salaries for various years in experience. The dataset
        was split into train and test sets using the train-test-split function 
        from the Sklearn module. The dataset was fitted into the training set
        and testing set, and visualisations drawn from these. It performed well
        as shown in the charts below <i>(the same performance was depicted
        when the model was tested on new data).</i><br>
        The complete code for this analysis can be downloaded from this

        The next block of diagrams demonstrate the implementation of K-Nearest
        Neighbors in creating a model that solves Classification problem under
        supervised learning. Initially, the K-Neighbors Classifier and the 
        Confusion Matrix were imported from the Sklearn module. Feature scaling 
        was applied to normalise the dataset after obtaining the train and 
        test splits from the data. The dataset used was CSV data containing the
        social status of different gender. The overall objective being to 
        classify different individuals according to their spending pattern 
        (either a '1' or '0') and tabulated salary.<br>
        The model's performance was fairly good <i>(owing to the fact that
        no model or data can achieve 100 percent perfection).</i> Slightly 
        increasing the dataset size for our model could yield better results
        with less anomalies. Below is the output obtained from the visualisations
        of train and test sets. My dataset and codes for this work can still be

        This last section seeks to illustrate the development of an algorithm 
        and a model to resolve unsupervised clustering problem. We examine a CSV 
        data containing the spending scales of mall customers of different 
        income levels. The machine model is developed in an attempt to help 
        cluster and relevantly group customers which in turn helps to tailor
        marketing strategies effectively for each study group. The WCSS and 
        the Elbow method was used to obtain a suitable cluster number for this
        analysis. Data was eventually plotted after pre-requisites were met.<br>
        The summary output is as below. This <a
