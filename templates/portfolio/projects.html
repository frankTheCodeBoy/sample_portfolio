        class="new-h">REAL-TIME API DATA VISUALISATION.</span></h5>
      <p>
          The concept of working efficiently with the API of a particular
          technology is what this project demonstrates. This includes the 
          following steps:- accessing the API and making an API call via 
          Python's request object, verifying and translating the data returned,
          and using Python's Plotly module to analyse and create a visualisation
          of this data.
          <br>
          The result is a neat graph with active links showing real-time data 
          at that moment. Below is one such graph which shows real-time data in 
          the form of "top news headlines in the USA". Each time the code is
          run, the graph updates to showthe most current news articles.
          I was able to accomplish this by working with the <i>NEWS API</i> and 
          by using a unique API-key. Below is the resulting visualisation.
          My code can quickly be accessed in my <a href="#">GitHub repository.
          </a><br>
          There is a similar visualisation to this one, drawn alongside. It was
          generated using data from <i>HACKER NEWS API</i>. At any instance of 
          running code, it will show the most commented topics in Hacker News 
          at that moment. For both these visualisations, the links on the 
          graphs once clicked, will navigate to the actual article.

      A BOOK-MARKING WEB APPLICATION.</span></h5>
      <p>
        This entry features a book-marking django web application which allows 
        users the ability to like 'Categories' and add 'Pages' to specific 
        select categories. Python is used alongside JavaScript, JQuery,
        and AJAX in order to implement and simulate dynamic features.<br>
        Authenticated users can freely interact with all features of the site 
        which include but not limited to:- profile accounts with enabled 
        profile-image uploads, personal website entries, viewing of other user
        profiles, and bio-message displays.<br>
        Styling was accomplished by custom CSS and Bootstrap4 application.
        Testing and debugging was done prior to deployment of the application
        online.<br>
        The application is fully-functional, readily accessible online, and goes
        by the name <a href="#">"Page-House"</a>. The copyright seal is also 
        denoted on the 'About Page' of the app.

        A PYGAME WITH PYTHON.
      </span></h5>
      <p>
        This is a game development project of a 2-D game built using Pygame, 
        a Python module. The game was created and designed using Python's 
        native class objects, and by consistently splitting code into manageable
        potions for further development. Writing this game offered me an 
        opportunity to enhance my game development and problem-solving skills.
        I had to grapple with the many challenges I faced, climb over huddles to
        create a working, playable game. I have titled this game as 
        'Game Character'; a particular game object (the player) combats enemy
        ships moving in a systematic manner up, down, and across the screen. 
        The game features escalating levels, a scoring system, an updated high 
        score and limited player-lives. I enhanced it by introducing sound and 
        music effects using Pygame Mixer module.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have included snapshots of my program including a short video file to
        demonstrate my works. My program code for this game can also be accessed
        in my GitHub repository to which I am <a href="#">linking here.</a>
