        class="new-h">REAL-TIME API DATA VISUALISATION.</span></h5>
      <p>
          The concept of working efficiently with the API of a particular
          technology is what this project demonstrates. This includes the 
          following steps:- accessing the API and making an API call via 
          Python's request object, verifying and translating the data returned,
          and using Python's Plotly module to analyse and create a visualisation
          of this data.
          <br>
          The result is a neat graph with active links showing real-time data 
          at that moment. Below is one such graph which shows real-time data in 
          the form of "top news headlines in the USA". Each time the code is
          run, the graph updates to showthe most current news articles.
          I was able to accomplish this by working with the <i>NEWS API</i> and 
          by using a unique API-key. Below is the resulting visualisation.
          My code can quickly be accessed in my <a href="#">GitHub repository.
          </a><br>
          There is a similar visualisation to this one, drawn alongside. It was
          generated using data from <i>HACKER NEWS API</i>. At any instance of 
          running code, it will show the most commented topics in Hacker News 
          at that moment. For both these visualisations, the links on the 
          graphs once clicked, will navigate to the actual article.

      A BOOK-MARKING WEB APPLICATION.</span></h5>
      <p>
        This entry features a book-marking django web application which allows 
        users the ability to like 'Categories' and add 'Pages' to specific 
        select categories. Python is used alongside JavaScript, JQuery,
        and AJAX in order to implement and simulate dynamic features.<br>
        Authenticated users can freely interact with all features of the site 
        which include but not limited to:- profile accounts with enabled 
        profile-image uploads, personal website entries, viewing of other user
        profiles, and bio-message displays.<br>
        Styling was accomplished by custom CSS and Bootstrap4 application.
        Testing and debugging was done prior to deployment of the application
        online.<br>
        The application is fully-functional, readily accessible online, and goes
        by the name <a href="#">"Page-House"</a>. The copyright seal is also 
        denoted on the 'About Page' of the app.

        A PYGAME WITH PYTHON.
      </span></h5>
      <p>
        This is a game development project comprising of a 2-D game built using 
        Pygame, a Python module. The game was created and designed using Python's 
        native class objects, and by consistently splitting code into manageable
        potions for further development. Writing this game offered me an 
        opportunity to enhance my game development and problem-solving skills.
        I had to grapple with the many challenges I faced, climb over huddles to
        create a working, playable game. I have titled this game as <i>'Game 
        Character'</i>; a particular game object (the player) combats enemy
        ships moving in a systematic manner up, down, and across the screen. 
        The game features escalating levels, a scoring system, an updated high 
        score and limited player-lives. I enhanced it by introducing sound and 
        music effects using Pygame Mixer module.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have included a snapshot of my program and a short video file below 
        to demonstrate my work. The complete code for this game can
        be accessed in my GitHub repository to which I am <a href="#">
        linking here.</a>

        <img class="img-game" src="{% static 'images/game_dev.jpg' %}">
      </div>
      <p>
        <i>Point of note: the video embedded is slightly shaky due to the fact
        that I was recording the screen interface with one hand while 
        simultaneously accessing the program and playing the game with my other 
        hand. You could however play the clip in full-screen mode or download
        it for improved clarity.</i>

        THE LEARNING LOG PROJECT.</span></h5>
      <p>This project is again a live web application built with Python and Django 
      framework. The application serves as an online journal for daily activity
      entry. Users register and create accounts to actively use it. The application 
      features topics; public and private topics, and entries which are added to
      topics created. Users track their activities and learning progress by 
      logging new topics and updating it with new ideas which appear in form
      of entries unique to owners.<br>
      Prior to deployment, necessary tests were conducted and git-tracking  was 
      enabled consistently. Code was finally configured for production after the 
      necessary migrations were conducted locally and on the server. This application 
      which is named <i>'Learning Log'</i>, is currently active and can be directly
      accessed through this <a href="#">link.</a>
      </p>
      <p><i>
        Point of note: depending on your network strength or location, the link
        to the web application may take roughly 5 - 7 seconds to load up at first.
        At the least, give it this minimum time limit.
