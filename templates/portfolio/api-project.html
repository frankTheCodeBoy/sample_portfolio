        <p>
          The concept of working efficiently with the API of a particular
          technology is what this project demonstrates. This includes the 
          following steps:- accessing the API and making an API call via 
          Python's request object, verifying and translating the data returned,
          and using Python's Plotly module to analyse and create a visualisation
          of this data.
          <br>
          The result is a neat graph with active links showing real-time data 
          at that moment. Below is one such graph which shows real-time data in 
          the form of "top news headlines in the USA". Each time the code is
          run, the graph updates to showthe most current news articles.
          I was able to accomplish this by working with the <i>NEWS API</i> and 
          by using a unique API-key. Below is the resulting visualisation.
          My code can quickly be accessed in my <a href="https://github.com/frankTheCodeBoy/REALTIME_API_DATA_AND_EARTHQUAKES_VISUALISATION">GitHub repository.
          </a><br>
          There is a similar visualisation to this one, drawn alongside. It was
          generated using data from <i>HACKER NEWS API</i>. At any instance of 
          running code, it will show the most commented topics in Hacker News 
          at that moment. For both these visualisations, the links on the 
          graphs once clicked, will navigate to the actual article.
